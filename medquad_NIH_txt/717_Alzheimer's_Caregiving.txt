Everyone needs help at times. However, many caregivers find it hard to ask for help. They may feel they should be able to do everything themselves, or that it's not all right to leave the person in their care with someone else. Or maybe they cant afford to pay someone to watch the person for an hour or two. Family members, friends, and community resources can help caregivers of people with Alzheimers disease. Here are some tips about asking for help. - It's okay to ask for help from family, friends, and others. You don't have to do everything yourself.  - Ask people to help out in specific ways, like making a meal, visiting the person, or taking the person out for a short time.   - Call for help from home health care or adult day care services when needed.   - Use national and local resources to find out how to pay for some of this help.
