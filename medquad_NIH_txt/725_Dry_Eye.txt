The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer surface that covers the eye in front of the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. The cornea helps protect the rest of the eye from germs, dust, and other harmful matter. The cornea is a highly organized, clear structure made up of a group of cells and proteins precisely arranged in layers, but it has no blood vessels to nourish or protect it against infection. Instead, it gets its nourishment from the tears and the watery fluid (aqueous humor) that fill the chamber behind it.
