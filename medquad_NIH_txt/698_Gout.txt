Gout is a form of arthritis that causes sudden onset of intense pain and swelling in the joints, which also may be warm and red. Attacks frequently occur at night and can be triggered by stressful events, alcohol or drugs, or the presence of another illness. Sometime during the course of the disease, many people will develop gout in the big toe. Gout frequently affects joints in the lower part of the body such as the knees, ankles, or toes.
