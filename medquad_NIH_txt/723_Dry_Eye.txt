There are two types of dry eye: aqueous tear-deficient dry eye and evaporative dry eye. Aqueous tear-deficient dry eye is a disorder in which the tear glands do not produce enough of the watery component of tears to maintain a healthy eye surface, called the cornea. Evaporative dry eye may result from inflammation of the meibomian glands, located in the eyelids. These glands make the oily part of tears that slows evaporation and keeps the tears stable. Dry eye can be associated with - inflammation of the surface of the eye (cornea), the lacrimal gland, or the conjunctiva (the surface layer of tissue that lines the eyelids and covers the front part of the eye)  - any disease process that alters the components of the tears  - an increase in the surface of the eye, as in thyroid disease when the eye bulges forward  - cosmetic surgery, if the eyelids are opened too widely. inflammation of the surface of the eye (cornea), the lacrimal gland, or the conjunctiva (the surface layer of tissue that lines the eyelids and covers the front part of the eye) any disease process that alters the components of the tears an increase in the surface of the eye, as in thyroid disease when the eye bulges forward cosmetic surgery, if the eyelids are opened too widely.
