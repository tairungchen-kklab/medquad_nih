Squamous cell carcinoma develops in the squamous cells of the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin. It is much less common than basal cell carcinoma and is rarely life-threatening. Squamous cell carcinoma occurs most often on parts of the body that have been exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, neck, hands and legs. However, it can be found on any part of the body.
