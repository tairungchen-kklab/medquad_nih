HDL stands for high-density lipoproteins. (Lipoproteins are molecules that carry cholesterol through your bloodstream.) HDL cholesterol is sometimes called good cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your artery walls and carries it to your liver. The liver then removes the cholesterol from your body. The higher your HDL cholesterol level, the lower your chances of getting heart disease.
