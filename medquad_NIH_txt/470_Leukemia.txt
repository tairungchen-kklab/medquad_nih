Clinical trials are research studies in which new treatments -- drugs, diagnostics, procedures, vaccines, and other therapies -- are tested in people to see if they are safe, effective, and better than the current standard of care. Clinical trials often compare a new treatment with a standard treatment to determine which one gives better results. People with leukemia who are interested in taking part in a clinical trial should contact their doctor or go to  www.clinical trials.gov and search "leukemia."
