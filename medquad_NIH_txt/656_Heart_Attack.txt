There are many medicines that are used to treat a heart attack. - Clot-busters or thrombolytic drugs dissolve blood clots that are blocking blood flow to the heart.  - Beta blockers decrease the workload on your heart by slowing your heart rate.  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lower your blood pressure and reduce the strain on your heart.  - Nitrates, such as nitroglycerin  relax blood vessels and relieve chest pain.  - Anticoagulants thin the blood and prevent clots from forming in your arteries.  - Antiplatelet medications, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, stop platelets from clumping together to form clots. These medications are given to people who have had a heart attack, have angina, or have had angioplasty.
