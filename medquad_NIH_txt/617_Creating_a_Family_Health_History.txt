People can't change the genes they inherit from their parents, but they can change other things to prevent diseases that run in the family. This is good news because many diseases result from a combination of a person's genes, lifestyle, and environment. Actions to reduce the risk of disease may involve lifestyle changes, such as eating healthier foods, exercising more, getting certain medical tests, and taking medicines that are more effective based on your specific genes. Ask your doctor or health care professional for advice.
