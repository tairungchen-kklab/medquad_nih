Quitting smoking not only cuts the risk of lung cancer, it cuts the risks of many other cancers as well as heart disease, stroke, other lung diseases, and other respiratory illnesses. Each U.S. state and territory has a free quitline to provide you with information and resources to help you quit smoking. To reach the quitline in your area, dial toll-free, 1-800-QUIT-NOW.
