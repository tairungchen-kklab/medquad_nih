Yes, you can prevent gum disease with proper dental hygiene and regular cleanings by your dentist or dental hygienist. Specifically, you should - brush your teeth twice a day (with a fluoride toothpaste).   - floss regularly to remove plaque from between teeth. Or use a device such as a special pick recommended by a dental professional.   - visit the dentist routinely for a check-up and professional cleaning.  - not smoke.  - eat a well-balanced diet.
