Basic research helps scientists gain new knowledge about a disease process, including how and why it starts and progresses. In Alzheimers disease, basic research seeks to identify the cellular, molecular, and genetic processes that lead to the disease. For example, scientists are studying - the ways in which plaques and tangles damage nerve cells in the brain  - the very earliest brain changes in the disease process  - the role of Alzheimers risk-factor genes in the development of the disease  - how risk-factor genes interact with other genes and lifestyle or environmental factors to affect Alzheimers risk. the ways in which plaques and tangles damage nerve cells in the brain the very earliest brain changes in the disease process the role of Alzheimers risk-factor genes in the development of the disease how risk-factor genes interact with other genes and lifestyle or environmental factors to affect Alzheimers risk.
