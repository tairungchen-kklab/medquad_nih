You can help your doctor make a diagnosis by writing down important information about your problem beforehand and giving the information to your doctor during your visit. Write down answers to the following questions. - When did I first become aware of the problem?  - Did I have a cold or the flu?  - Did I have a head injury?   - Was I exposed to air pollutants, pollen, pet dander, or dust to which I might be allergic?  - Is this a recurring problem?  - Does it come at any special time, such as during the hay fever season?
