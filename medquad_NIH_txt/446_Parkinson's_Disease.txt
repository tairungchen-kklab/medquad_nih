Doctors may prescribe a variety of medications to treat the non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as depression and anxiety. Hallucinations, delusions, and other psychotic symptoms may be caused by some drugs prescribed for Parkinson's. Therefore, reducing or stopping those Parkinson's medications may make these symptoms of psychosis go away. A variety of treatment options, including medications, also are available to treat orthostatic hypotension, the sudden drop in blood pressure that occurs upon standing.
