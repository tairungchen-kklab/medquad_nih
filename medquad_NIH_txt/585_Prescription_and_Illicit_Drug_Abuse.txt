A persons behavior, especially changes in behavior, can signal a possible substance abuse problem. For example, you may notice that an older adult seems worried about whether a medicine is really working, or complains that a doctor refuses to write a prescription. He or she may have new problems doing everyday tasks or withdraw from family, friends, and normal activities. Other possible warning signs include - rapid increases in the amount of medication needed  - frequent requests for refills of certain medicines  - a person not seeming like themselves (showing a general lack of interest or being overly energetic)  - "doctor shopping" -- moving from provider to provider in an effort to get several prescriptions for the same medication  - use of more than one pharmacy  - false or forged prescriptions. rapid increases in the amount of medication needed frequent requests for refills of certain medicines a person not seeming like themselves (showing a general lack of interest or being overly energetic) "doctor shopping" -- moving from provider to provider in an effort to get several prescriptions for the same medication use of more than one pharmacy false or forged prescriptions.
