Doctors can perform several tests to stage lung cancer. Staging means finding out how far the cancer has progressed. The following tests are used to stage lung cancer: - Computerized tomography or CAT scan is a computer linked to an x-ray machine that creates a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.

The patient receives a general anesthetic for this procedure. A bone scan uses a small amount of a radioactive substance to show whether cancer has spread to the bones.
