Saliva does more than keep your mouth wet. It helps digest food, protects teeth from decay, helps to heal sores in your mouth, and prevents infection by controlling bacteria, viruses, and fungi in the mouth. Saliva is also what helps us chew and swallow. Each of these functions of saliva is hampered when a person has dry mouth.
