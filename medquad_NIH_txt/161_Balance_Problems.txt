In BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo), small calcium particles in the inner ear become displaced, causing dizziness.

An NIDCD-supported clinical trial in BPPV showed that repositioning maneuvers work well, and offered clinicians a range of choices in selecting the treatment best suited to each individuals unique needs.
