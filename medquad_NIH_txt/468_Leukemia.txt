Biological therapy is a treatment that uses a person's own immune system to fight leukemia. This therapy uses special substances to stimulate the immune system's ability to fight cancer. Some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia receive monoclonal antibodies, which are man-made proteins that can identify leukemia cells and help the body kill them.
