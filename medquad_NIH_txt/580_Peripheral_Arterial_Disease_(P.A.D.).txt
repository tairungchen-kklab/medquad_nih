The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) supports research aimed at learning more about peripheral arterial disease (P.A.D.). For example, NHLBI-supported research on P.A.D. includes studies that - explore whether group walking sessions increase physical activity in people who have P.A.D.  - compare how effective certain exercise programs are at reducing leg pain in people who have P.A.D.  - examine how inflammation and insulin resistance affect people who have P.A.D.  explore whether group walking sessions increase physical activity in people who have P.A.D. compare how effective certain exercise programs are at reducing leg pain in people who have P.A.D. examine how inflammation and insulin resistance affect people who have P.A.D. Much of this research depends on the willingness of volunteers to take part in clinical trials. Clinical trials test new ways to prevent, diagnose, or treat various diseases and conditions. Carefully conducted clinical trials are the fastest and safest way to find treatments that work in people and ways to improve health. For more information about clinical trials related to P.A.D., talk with your doctor.
