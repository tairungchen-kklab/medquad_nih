The Parkinsons Disease Biomarkers Identification Network, or PD-BIN, is an initiative developed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to discover and validate biomarkers for Parkinsons disease. Biomarkers are measurable characteristics that can reveal whether the disease is developing or progressing. Biomarkers could help doctors detect Parkinsons disease before symptoms appear and improve diagnosis of the disorder.
