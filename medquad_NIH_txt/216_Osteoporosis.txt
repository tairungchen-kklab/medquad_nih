Scientists are pursuing a wide range of basic and clinical studies on osteoporosis. Significant advances in preventing and treating osteoporosis continue to be made. Such advances are the direct result of research focused on -  determining the causes and consequences of bone loss at the cellular and tissue levels  - assessing risk factors  - developing new strategies to maintain and even enhance bone density and reduce fracture risk  - exploring the roles of such factors as genetics, hormones, calcium, vitamin D, drugs, and exercise on bone mass. determining the causes and consequences of bone loss at the cellular and tissue levels assessing risk factors developing new strategies to maintain and even enhance bone density and reduce fracture risk exploring the roles of such factors as genetics, hormones, calcium, vitamin D, drugs, and exercise on bone mass.
