Most people who have rheumatoid arthritis take medications. Some drugs only provide relief for pain; others reduce inflammation. Still others, called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or DMARDs, can often slow the course of the disease. - DMARDs include methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, and cyclosporine.   - Steroids, which are also called corticosteroids, are another type of drug used to reduce inflammation for people with rheumatoid arthritis. Cortisone, hydrocortisone, and prednisone are some commonly used steroids.   - DMARDs called biological response modifiers also can help reduce joint damage. These drugs include etanercept, infliximab, and anakinra.   - Another DMARD, tofacitinib, from a new class of drugs called jak kinase (JAK) inhibitors is also available.

Early treatment with powerful drugs and drug combinations -- including biological response modifiers and DMARDs -- instead of single drugs may help prevent the disease from progressing and greatly reduce joint damage.
