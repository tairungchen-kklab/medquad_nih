Once initial tests have been performed, your doctor may decide to send you to a cardiologist, a specialist in diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. A cardiologist will perform a physical exam and may order other tests. There are several tests that can identify the cause of heart failure. These tests include: - An echocardiogram is one of the most useful tests for diagnosing heart failure. This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart and shows how well the heart is filling with blood. Your doctor uses this test to determine whether any areas of your heart are damaged.
