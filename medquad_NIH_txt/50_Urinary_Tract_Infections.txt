Although everyone has some risk for UTIs, some people are more likely to get UTIs than others. These include people who have -  spinal cord injuries or other nerve damage around the bladder   -  a blockage in the urinary tract that can trap urine in the bladder. A blockage in the urinary tract can be caused by kidney stones, an enlarged prostate, or a birth defect.   -  diabetes   -  problems with the bodys natural defense (or immune) system   -  pelvic organ prolapse, which is when pelvic organs (such as the bladder, rectum, or uterus) shift out of their normal position into the vagina. When pelvic organs are out of place, they can push on the bladder and urethra and make it hard to fully empty the bladder. This causes urine to stay in the bladder. When urine stays in the bladder too long, it makes an infection more likely.  spinal cord injuries or other nerve damage around the bladder a blockage in the urinary tract that can trap urine in the bladder.
