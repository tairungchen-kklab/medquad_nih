Genetics is one of the most exciting areas of Parkinson's disease research. Studying the genes responsible for inherited cases can help researchers understand both inherited and sporadic cases of the disease. Sporadic means the disease occurs randomly and does not seem to run in families. Identifying gene defects can also help researchers - understand how the disease occurs   - develop animal models that accurately mimic the death of nerve cells in human Parkinson's disease  - identify new drug targets   - improve diagnosis. understand how the disease occurs develop animal models that accurately mimic the death of nerve cells in human Parkinson's disease identify new drug targets improve diagnosis.
