People with Alzheimer's disease, those with mild cognitive impairment, those with a family history of Alzheimers, and healthy people with no memory problems who want to help scientists test new treatments may be able to take part in clinical trials. Participants in clinical trials help scientists learn about the brain in healthy aging as well as what happens in Alzheimers. Results of these trials are used to improve prevention and treatment methods. To find out more about Alzheimers clinical trials, talk to your health care provider or contact the Alzheimers Disease Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center at 1-800-438-4380.
