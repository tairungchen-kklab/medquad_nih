The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has launched a broad effort called NIH Exploratory Trials in Parkinson's Disease, or NET-PD, to find drugs to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease. The first studies tested several compounds. One of these, a nutritional supplement called creatine, is now being evaluated in a larger clinical trial to find out if it slows the clinical decline seen in people with Parkinson's disease.
