Various drugs are under study as possible treatments for colorectal cancer. A 2005 study found that patients who took the drug AvastinTM with their standard chemotherapy treatment had a longer progression-free survival than those who did not take Avastin, but the evidence is mixed on whether or not Avastin can extend life. (The generic name for Avastin is bevacizumab.) Scientists are also working on vaccine therapies and monoclonal antibodies that may improve how patients' immune systems respond to colorectal cancers. Monoclonal antibodies are a single type of antibody that researchers make in large amounts in a laboratory.
