Recovering from addiction is hard. Even with treatment, many people return to substance abuse, sometimes months or years after having stopped drug use. This is commonly referred to as relapse. As with most chronic diseases, relapse in addiction is not unusual, and signals a need to restart, adjust, or modify the treatment.
