Call your doctor right away if your symptoms worsen suddenly. People with COPD may have symptoms that suddenly get worse. When this happens, you have a much harder time catching your breath. Symptoms that worsen suddenly can include sudden chest tightness, more coughing, a change in your sputum (mucus), or fever. Your doctor will look at things that may be causing these sudden symptoms. Sometimes the symptoms are caused by a lung infection.
