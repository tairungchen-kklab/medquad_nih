Depending on the cause of your taste disorder, your doctor may be able to treat your problem or suggest ways to cope with it. If a certain medication is the cause of the problem, your doctor may be able to adjust or change your medicine. Your doctor will work with you to get the medicine you need while trying to reduce unwanted side effects. Some patients with respiratory infections regain their sense of taste when the illness is over. Often, correcting a general medical problem can restore the sense of taste. Occasionally, the sense of taste returns to normal on its own without any treatment.
