Having psoriasis may cause you to feel self-conscious, particularly if it affects a part of the body that others can see. Some people plan their clothing  such as long skirts vs. knee-length or long-sleeve instead of short-sleeve shirts  to hide affected skin. Others withdraw from sports and other activities where affected skin would show. Pain, itching, and other symptoms can lead to frustration. Uncertainty over the course of the disease or the need for ongoing treatment may cause you to feel anxious or depressed. In some cases psoriasis symptoms make it difficult or impossible for people keep up with their jobs, household chores, or favorite activities. Having to give up a job or favorite hobby can further increase the risk of emotional problems.
