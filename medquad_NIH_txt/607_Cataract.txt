Here are several things you can do to lower your risk for cataract. Have regular eye exams. Eye exams can help detect cataracts and other age-related eye problems at their earliest stages. If you are age 60 or older, you should have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. In addition to cataract, your eye care professional can check for signs of age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and other vision disorders. For many eye diseases, early treatment may save your sight. Quit smoking. Ask your doctor for help to stop smoking. Medications, counseling and other strategies are available to help you. Wear sunglasses.  Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet B (UVB) rays when you're outdoors. Take care of other health problems.  Follow your treatment plan if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that can increase your risk of cataracts. Maintain a healthy weight. If your current weight is a healthy one, work to maintain it by exercising most days of the week. If you're overweight or obese, work to lose weight slowly by reducing your calorie intake and increasing the amount of exercise you get each day. Choose a healthy diet. A diet that includes plenty of colorful fruits and vegetables ensures that you're getting a lot of vitamins and nutrients, which in theory could prevent damage to your eye's lens.
