People who choose Original Medicare may wish to consider Medigap, a type of Medicare supplement insurance. Medigap policies are sold by private insurance companies to fill gaps in Original Medicare Plan coverage, such as out-of-pocket costs for Medicare co-insurance and deductibles, or for services not covered by Medicare. A Medigap policy only works with Original Medicare. A person who joins a Medicare Advantage Plan generally doesn't need (and can't use) a Medigap policy. For more information about Medigap policies, visit  http://www.medicare.gov to view a copy of "Choosing a Medigap Policy: A Guide to Health Insurance for People with Medicare." (Under "Search Tools," select "Find a Medicare Publication.") You can also call 1-800-Medicare (1-800-633-4227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.
