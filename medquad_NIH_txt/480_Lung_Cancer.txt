There are two major types of lung cancer -- non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Each type of lung cancer grows and spreads in different ways, and each is treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is more common than small cell lung cancer. It generally grows and spreads slowly.  Learn more about non-small cell carcinoma.  Small cell lung cancer,  sometimes called oat cell cancer, grows more quickly and is more likely to spread to other organs in the body.  Learn more about small cell carcinoma.
