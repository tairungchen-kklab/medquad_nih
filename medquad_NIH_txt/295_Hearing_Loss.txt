Researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health are studying the causes of hearing loss as well as new treatments. For example, they are studying ways to improve hearing aids so that you can hear certain sounds more clearly even when you are surrounded by background noise. They are also working to to improve cochlear implants and develop diagnostic methods to determine who would benefit from two versus one cochlear implant, especially in young children. Finding ways to improve access to accessible and affordable hearing health care, including screening and assessment, hearing aid selection and fitting, and rehabilitation of hearing loss, is also a goal of currently funded research.
