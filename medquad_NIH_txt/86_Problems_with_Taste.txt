Yes. Certain medicines can cause a change in our ability to taste. The medicines that most frequently do this are certain antibiotics and some antihistamines, although other medications can affect our sense of taste as well. If your medicine is causing a problem with your sense of taste, your doctor may be able to adjust or change your medicine. If not, he or she may suggest ways to manage your problem. Do not stop taking your medications unless directed by your doctor. Your doctor will work with you to get the medicine you need while trying to reduce unwanted side effects.
